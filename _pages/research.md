### Interpretation of Deep Learning Results
The interpretation of clinical biopsy images for disease diagnoses can be challenging when clinicians are faced
with distinguishing between distinct but related conditions. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to methods
in artificial intelligence that help clinicians to translate big data into accurate and quantitative diagnostics. In
contrast, deep learning or a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a form of artificial intelligence that includes
machine learning techniques designed to process data and interpret it (eg, by detecting and segmenting multiple
pixel intensities within a single image and labeling features at a pixel-by-pixel level).
